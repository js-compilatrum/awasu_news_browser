'''
CONCEPT_DEBUG = False # Debug, set True to use CSV_TEST_DATA
CSV_BASE_SOURCE = r'D:\json\all_unread_channels.json'  ##### Here ara articles saved from Awasu
CSV_TEST_DATA = r'D:\csv\concept_debug.csv'  ##### Here are test articles
OUTPUT_DIR = r'D:\articles\selected'  ##### Where save selected articles as txt and csv

TOKEN = "secret_Awasu_API_token"

#### Details how run read in Flask documentation:
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/

Default:
C:\path\to\app>set FLASK_APP=hello.py
python -m flask run

or try simple:
python app.py (it's work for me on Windows 7)

Tested on Python 3.7.2 and 3.8.1

### Awasu configuration

---
Use JSON.template an Awasu => 3.2 from awasu directory:

#### Search Agents ####

If you like use Search Agents name it with prefix 'M > '. If you curious why I use M. It is because M is from Meta as I see from beginning agregation a lot of channels in other one.

#### Performance ####
It's typical than when updating script is slowing down. Typical processing time on second generation i7 quad core with 32 GB RAM is below 120 sec to get data from Awasu.

## History
